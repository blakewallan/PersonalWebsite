                <p class="about-me">My name is Blake Allan. I am a student
                currently residing in Bellingham, Washington. I have spent the
                last few years working on a degree in computer science as well
                as spending as much time as I can teaching myself new concepts
                and pushing myself with personal projects.</p>


                <p class="about-me">I spend time hiking, watching movies and
                television shows, working on old Audis, fixing things,
                tinkering with computers, writing code, playing video games and
                hanging out with my dog.</p>


                <p class="about-me">I am pursuing a position in General Assembly's
                Web Development Immersive program this November. I have a strong desire to
                acquire new skills and become an experienced Web Developer. An
                accelerated learning environment is a perfect fit for my
                personality and I tend to produce my best work in a fast paced
                and challenging environment.</p>

                <h2 class="section-subheading">Movie File Cleaner:</h2>


                <p class="about-me">This was a project I came up with to brush
                up on my python skills. It is a simple script that scans the
                user's movie folder and deletes any files that are under a
                certain file size to get rid of sample videos and uploader
                advertisement videos, as well as file types that the user
                doesn't want such as uploader advertisements in text files or
                pictures. The program uses a TK GUI for the user to select the
                directory, then show the amount of files scanned, bad files found,
                and space to be cleared, and finally confirm that they would
                like to delete. I am currently adding a feature that will also
                clean up directory and file names so they follow a
                "movie-title.year-produced.extension" format. I am achieving
                this by using removing unnecessary characters from the file
                name, then using Bing's API to search the file name on IMDB's
                website. After the program gets the URL, I use a package called
                IMDBpy that retrieves all the movie information by URL. I look
                forward to completing this project over time. Check it out
                here: <a href=

                <p class="about-me">Learning to create this website has been a
                very valuable experience, in fact it inspired me to pursue Web
                Development. At the moment it uses Twitter bootstrap for the
                navigation, buttons and layout. It also uses javascript for its
                single page navigation. I started this project about a month
                ago to dip my toe in the Web Development pond, and it has gone
                through massive overhauls almost every week as I learn new
                skills. As I said above, it is a constant work in progress and
                I hope to see it improve over time. Check it out here: <a href=
